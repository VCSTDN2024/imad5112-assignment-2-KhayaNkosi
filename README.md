## Project Overview

The **Q and A** is a mobile application developed as part of an assignment in the IMAD5112 subject. This application was created using **Kotlin** and **Android Studio**. The app's primary purpose is to test peoples knolegde of astronomy and the world.

The app was developed to meet the requirements of the assignment, which includes creating a functional mobile app and utilizing GitHub for version control and CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions.


3. App Purpose and Features
---------------------------

## Purpose and Features

### Purpose:
The main goal of this app is to ask questions if the questions that are asked are true or false. 

### Key Features:
- Feature 1: The welcome page where it starts with a welcome message on the welcome page. 
- Feature 2: The button that makes the app begin and takes you to the next screen

- Feature 4: The result page showing the results and a reset and restart button
- Feature 5: The end page 
These features aim to provide simple access to the app and easy to use for people who struggle to use phones and want to test their knowledge 


4. Design Considerations
------------------------


## Design Considerations

The design of the **Q and A** was based on the following key considerations:

1. **User Experience (UX)**: The app was designed for people to use it easy with the button to take them  to the next question and true and false buttons 
   
2. **Responsiveness**: The performance of the app is very good , it takes a moment to go to the results page but the aapp on its own fuctions well.
   
3. **Simplicity**: The Apps design is pretty simple the app does have alot of diffrent things on it. it has a very simple set up to it just a few buttons and that it
   
4. **Performance**: The App doesn't take alot of battery percentage.

5. **

Why:
----
- Highlights the thought process behind the design choices. It demonstrates that students are considering not just the functionality, but also the usability and performance aspects of the app, which is a professional approach.

5. GitHub and GitHub Actions Utilization
----------------------------------------


I utilized GitHub Actions to automate the build and deployment process. This includes: 
Running automated tests such as build.yml to ensure the app’s functionality. 
Compiling the app into APK and AAB files, which are the formats required for distribution. 
Uploading these build artifacts to GitHub for easy access. 
The workflow ensures that my project is automatically built and tested every time I push 
changes, and it simplifies the process of delivering the final APK/AAB files for submission. 


6. Screenshots and App Demo

7. Challenges and Learnings
---------------------------


## Challenges and Learnings

During the development of this project, I encountered several challenges, including:

1. **Challenge 1**: The one kotlin files the arrays were not linked
   - **Solution**: just linked the the arrays from exp kotlin file to the results kotlin file. 
   
2. **Challenge 2**: put in the wrong variable name 
   - **Solution**: put in the correct variable

From these challenges, I learned important lessons in debugging, using version control, and automating build processes with GitHub Actions.


8. Future Enhancements
----------------------
## Future Enhancements

While the current version of the app provides the core functionality, there are several features that could be added in the future, including:

1. **Feature 1**: add confetti when the person get them all correct
2. **Feature 2**: ask the person if they are sure they correct when they input an answer
3. **Feature 3**: 

These enhancements would improve the app’s usability and make it even more versatile for end-users.
